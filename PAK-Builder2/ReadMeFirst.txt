Hi and welcome to my seconed little Text Packer Program. I made this program about
two month ago. for packing Icons files load of icons into one big file.
Well any way I desided to update the program to Pack text files.

Ok to use the program is quit easy.

Open the PAK-Builder folder and locate the text-Files folder with this program
Ok you will see all the text files in the listbox just click the compile button.
Ok Exit the program and you will see a file in the PakFiles Folder called MyPakfile.pkg

Right copy this file to the PAK Extracter folder and run the extracter program
Click on the MyPakfile.pkg file and click the Extract Button. Ok now open the files folder
and you will see all the text files have been Extracted back to normal and with the right filenames.

Ok well I hope you like this program anyway. Place vote if you like it.


OK How to use the SFX Builder well with the file you have created MyPakfile.pkg copy that to 
were you like and load up the Sfx-Builder.exe and select the file you compiled MyPakfile.pkg or what ever you called it
click the Build button and it will then build the file into a self extracting exe.


I am also working in a new verison comming soon.

Bye.
