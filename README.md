## PAK Builder


</div>

### Description

This is a small program that I use to pak text file into one big one. It does not add an compression to the file just paks them in to one I hope to add some compression into it soon or when I can find some infor on how to do that.

Any way I have also included a Winzip like Self extracter that you can build the pak file in to exe and run them on any computer. as long as vb runtimes are installed anyway

Hope you lile the code.
